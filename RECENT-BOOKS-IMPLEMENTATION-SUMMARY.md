## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Recent Books** - Top section for immediate access
2. **Library** - Full book list below

### Colors & Styling
- Uses existing CSS variables for consistency
- Progress bar: Gradient from `--accent-primary` to `--accent-primary-hover`
- Active book: Highlighted with `--accent-primary` background
- Hover effects: Border color changes and subtle lift animation

### Interactions
- Click anywhere on recent book card → Opens book
- Click "Continue" button → Opens book and jumps to last page
- Click collapse button → Toggles section visibility
- Smooth transitions and animations throughout

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### As a User:
1. Open the application
2. The "Recently Opened" section appears at the top of the sidebar
3. Open any book from your library
4. The book appears in the recent section with progress bar
5. Click "Continue" to resume reading from where you left off
6. Click the collapse button (▲) to hide the section if desired

### For Developers:
```typescript
// Get recent books in any component
this.bookService.getRecentBooks(5).subscribe(books => {
  console.log('Recent books:', books);
});

// Update last opened timestamp
this.bookService.updateLastOpened(bookId).subscribe(() => {
  console.log('Timestamp updated');
});
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Recent books fetched on component initialization
- Limit default set to 5 to minimize data transfer
- Progress calculation done in backend
- Frontend uses observables for reactive updates
- CSS transitions use GPU acceleration
- No polling - updates on user actions only

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Real-time sync** - Update recent list when books opened in another session
2. **Sorting options** - Allow user to sort by progress, title, etc.
3. **Pin favorites** - Ability to pin specific books to always show
4. **Reading streaks** - Show badges for consecutive reading days
5. **Quick stats** - Display total reading time in recent section
6. **Drag to reorder** - Manual ordering of recent books
7. **Filter by completion** - Show only in-progress or completed books
8. **Recently finished** - Separate section for recently completed books
